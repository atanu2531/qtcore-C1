Everything else

## List of registers and sizes

- **Program Counter (PC)**: 8 bits - Stores the address of the next instruction to be executed.
- **Accumulator (ACC)**: 8 bits - Stores the result of arithmetic and logical operations, as well as acts as a temporary storage for addresses during certain operations (e.g., JSR instruction).
- **Instruction Register (IR)**: 8 bits - Stores the current instruction being executed.
- **Segment Register (SEG)**: 4 bits - Handles the segment for memory operations.

This is the definition of the control unit:

                                        // 00: Immediate value (SETSEG)
                                        // 01: ACC value (SETSEG_ACC)

    // Scan chain signals
    input wire scan_enable,             // Scan chain enable signal
    input wire scan_in,                 // Scan chain input

```

There is an embedded scan chain for this processor. It will be in the order control unit -> 

## TASK

We are making the datapath for this processor.

This is what we have so far:
```verilog
module accumulator_microcontroller #(
    parameter MEM_SIZE = 32
) 
(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    input wire scan_enable,
    input wire scan_in,
    output wire scan_out,
    input wire proc_en,
    output wire halt,

    input wire btn_in,
    output wire [6:0] led_out
);
```

Can you begin by listing all wires that will be needed? 

## ASSISTANT
Sure. I will list all the internal and external wires that you will need to build the datapath for the accumulator-based microcontroller you described.

Note: The lengths of these wires are based on the requirements of the architecture as you described in the previous instruction set and control unit module. Please adjust them if you see that your actual design requirements are different.

```verilog
// Internal Wires

// Wires between the Control Unit and the Datapath
wire PC_write_enable, ACC_write_enable, IR_load_enable, Memory_write_enable, CSR_write_enable, SEG_write_enable;
wire [1:0] PC_mux_select, ACC_mux_select, Memory_address_mux_select, SEG_mux_select;
wire [3:0] ALU_opcode;
wire ALU_inputB_mux_select;
wire illegal_segment_execution;
wire ZF; // zero flag from ALU

// PC - Program Counter
wire [7:0] PC, PC_plus_one, PC_plus_offset, PC_minus_offset, next_PC;

// ACC - Accumulator
wire [7:0] ACC, next_ACC;

// IR - Instruction Register
wire [7:0] IR, next_IR;

// SEG - Segment Register
wire [3:0] SEG, next_SEG;

// ALU - Arithmetic and Logic Unit
wire [7:0] ALU_result;

// Memory
wire [7:0] M_address;
wire [7:0] M_data_in, M_data_out;

// CSR - Control/Status Register
wire [2:0] CSR_address;
wire [7:0] CSR_data_in, CSR_data_out;

// Immediate Values
wire [7:0] IMM;

// Sign + Offset for Branching Instructions
wire sign;
wire [2:0] offset;

// External Wires

// Processor Interface
input wire clk, rst, proc_en, scan_enable, scan_in;
output wire halt, scan_out;

// I/O for button and LEDs
input wire btn_in;
output wire [6:0] led_out;
```


## USER
Can you add the scan chain connections as well?

## ASSISTANT
Sure, I can do that. You've already started a scan chain, so let's include it in the datapath.

To achieve this, we'll need to extend the scan chain through the various registers of your system. 

The scan chain is used to test digital systems. It works by shifting data through all registers in the system and then reading it back out to check that everything is functioning correctly.

The scan chain connections you need will look something like this:

```verilog
// Scan chain
wire scan_in_PC, scan_out_PC;       // Scan chain connections for PC
wire scan_in_ACC, scan_out_ACC;     // Scan chain connections for ACC
wire scan_in_IR, scan_out_IR;       // Scan chain connections for IR
wire scan_in_SEG, scan_out_SEG;     // Scan chain connections for SEG
wire scan_in_memory, scan_out_memory; // Scan chain connections for memory
wire scan_in_CSR, scan_out_CSR;     // Scan chain connections for CSR
```

We need a pair of scan_in/scan_out connections for each register module in the design.

Each module will have its own scan_in and scan_out. The scan_out of each module will connect to the scan_in of the next module, thus creating a chain. 

The 'scan_in' of the first module in the chain will be connected to the main 'scan_in', and the 'scan_out' of the last module in the chain will be connected to the main 'scan_out'.

## USER
Okay. Can you instantiate the control unit now with the provided definition and connect it to the listed wires?

## ASSISTANT
Absolutely, I will now instantiate the control unit module you provided. I will be connecting the control unit to the rest of the microcontroller system using the wires we defined earlier. Here is the control unit instantiation:

```verilog
control_unit ctrl_unit (
    .clk(clk),                              // Connected to the clock
    .rst(rst),                              // Connected to the reset signal
    .processor_enable(proc_en),             // Connected to the processor enable signal
    .illegal_segment_execution(illegal_segment_execution), // Illegal segment execution signal
    .processor_halted(halt),                // Connected to the processor halted signal
    .instruction(IR),                       // Connected to the instruction register output
    .ZF(ZF),                                // Zero Flag input from ALU
    .PC_write_enable(PC_write_enable),      // Enables writing to the PC
    .PC_mux_select(PC_mux_select),          // Selects the input for the PC multiplexer
    .ACC_write_enable(ACC_write_enable),    // Enables writing to the ACC
    .ACC_mux_select(ACC_mux_select),        // Selects the input for the ACC multiplexer
    .IR_load_enable(IR_load_enable),        // Enables loading new instruction into IR from memory
    .ALU_opcode(ALU_opcode),                // Control signal specifying the ALU operation
    .ALU_inputB_mux_select(ALU_inputB_mux_select), // Selects input B for the ALU multiplexer
    .Memory_write_enable(Memory_write_enable), // Enables writing to memory
    .Memory_address_mux_select(Memory_address_mux_select), // Selects input for memory address multiplexer
    .CSR_write_enable(CSR_write_enable),    // Enables writing to CSR
    .SEG_write_enable(SEG_write_enable),    // Enables writing to the Segment Register
    .SEG_mux_select(SEG_mux_select),        // Selects the input for the Segment Register multiplexer
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),              // Scan chain enable signal
    .scan_in(scan_in),                      // Scan chain input
    .scan_out(scan_out)                     // Scan chain output
);
```

I've connected each wire to its corresponding port in the control unit. I've also connected the clock (`clk`), reset (`rst`), and scan signals to the control unit. Please note that the `scan_out` and `scan_in` wires are also part of the scan chain you mentioned, so they will need to be connected to other parts of your design as well.

## USER
Can you now instantiate the segment register and the mux for its input? Use this definition of a shift register for the register:
```
module shift_register #(
    parameter WIDTH = 8
)(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    input wire enable,
    input wire [WIDTH-1:0] data_in,
    output wire [WIDTH-1:0] data_out,
    input wire scan_enable,
    input wire scan_in,
    output wire scan_out
);
```

## ASSISTANT
Sure, I'll create an instance of the `shift_register` module to act as our Segment Register (SEG). We'll also need a 2-to-1 multiplexer to select the input to this register. Here's the code:

```verilog
// SEG register instantiation
shift_register #(
    .WIDTH(4)  // Set width to 4 bits
) SEG (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .enable(SEG_write_enable),
    .data_in(SEG_input),
    .data_out(SEG),
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),
    .scan_in(scan_in_SEG),
    .scan_out(scan_out_SEG)
);

// Multiplexer for selecting SEG input
wire [3:0] SEG_input;
wire [3:0] IMM4 = instruction[3:0];   // Immediate 4-bit value from instruction
assign SEG_input = (SEG_mux_select) ? ACC[3:0] : IMM4;
```

In the code above, the `shift_register` is instantiated with a width of 4 to match the size of the SEG register. It is named `SEG` and connected to the relevant control and data signals.

Then, we declare a 4-bit wire `SEG_input` which is the output of the multiplexer. This wire is connected to the `data_in` of `SEG`.

The multiplexer is implemented using a conditional assignment (`assign`) statement. If `SEG_mux_select` is high, the multiplexer selects the lower 4 bits of the accumulator (ACC[3:0]); otherwise, it selects a 4-bit immediate value from the instruction. 

Please replace `instruction[3:0]` with the actual 4-bit immediate field from the instruction. It might be `IR[3:0]` or similar, based on your design.

## USER
the control unit scan_in and scan_out need to also be broken out - can you make scan_in_CU and scan_out_CU and wire them appropriately?

## ASSISTANT
Of course, you are right. We should have dedicated wires for the `scan_in` and `scan_out` of the Control Unit (CU) for clarity and to allow the scan chain to be correctly wired up. Here is the revised code:

```verilog
// Define scan chain wires for Control Unit
wire scan_in_CU, scan_out_CU;

// Update control_unit instantiation with scan chain wires
control_unit ctrl_unit (
    // Other connections...
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),            // Scan chain enable signal
    .scan_in(scan_in_CU),                 // Scan chain input
    .scan_out(scan_out_CU)                // Scan chain output
);

// Define SEG scan chain wires
wire scan_in_SEG, scan_out_SEG;

// Update shift_register instantiation with scan chain wires
shift_register #(
    .WIDTH(4)  // Set width to 4 bits
) SEG (
    // Other connections...
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),            // Scan chain enable signal
    .scan_in(scan_in_SEG),                // Scan chain input
    .scan_out(scan_out_SEG)               // Scan chain output
);

// Assign SEG_input with mux
wire [3:0] SEG_input;
wire [3:0] IMM4 = instruction[3:0];   // Immediate 4-bit value from instruction
assign SEG_input = (SEG_mux_select) ? ACC[3:0] : IMM4;
```

In this revised code, the scan chain input and output for the Control Unit are now separately defined as `scan_in_CU` and `scan_out_CU`. They replace the previous `scan_in` and `scan_out` in the control_unit instantiation. The same changes are made for the `shift_register` instantiation. This will allow you to route these scan chain connections to other modules as necessary.

## USER
can you call SEG register as SEG_Register or something? You have SEG the register and SEG the wire and they can't share names

## ASSISTANT
You're right, my mistake. I should have given them distinct names. Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
// Define scan chain wires for Control Unit
wire scan_in_CU, scan_out_CU;

// Update control_unit instantiation with scan chain wires
control_unit ctrl_unit (
    // Other connections...
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),            // Scan chain enable signal
    .scan_in(scan_in_CU),                // Scan chain input
    .scan_out(scan_out_CU)               // Scan chain output
);

// Define SEG scan chain wires
wire scan_in_SEG, scan_out_SEG;

// SEG register instantiation
shift_register #(
    .WIDTH(4)  // Set width to 4 bits
) SEG_Register (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .enable(SEG_write_enable),
    .data_in(SEG_input),
    .data_out(SEG),
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),            // Scan chain enable signal
    .scan_in(scan_in_SEG),                // Scan chain input
    .scan_out(scan_out_SEG)               // Scan chain output
);

// Multiplexer for selecting SEG input
wire [3:0] SEG_input;
wire [3:0] IMM4 = instruction[3:0];   // Immediate 4-bit value from instruction
assign SEG_input = (SEG_mux_select) ? ACC[3:0] : IMM4;
```

In this corrected version, the SEG register module is named `SEG_Register` to distinguish it from the wire `SEG` which carries its output. Please replace `instruction[3:0]` with the correct wire if necessary.

## USER
The signal containing the instruction is called IR. Update the multiplexer for selecting the SEG input to use IR?

## ASSISTANT
Sure, here's the code with `IR` replacing `instruction`:

```verilog
// Define SEG scan chain wires
wire scan_in_SEG, scan_out_SEG;

// SEG register instantiation
shift_register #(
    .WIDTH(4)  // Set width to 4 bits
) SEG_Register (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .enable(SEG_write_enable),
    .data_in(SEG_input),
    .data_out(SEG),
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),            // Scan chain enable signal
    .scan_in(scan_in_SEG),                // Scan chain input
    .scan_out(scan_out_SEG)               // Scan chain output
);

// Multiplexer for selecting SEG input
wire [3:0] SEG_input;
wire [3:0] IMM4 = IR[3:0];   // Immediate 4-bit value from instruction
assign SEG_input = (SEG_mux_select) ? ACC[3:0] : IMM4;
```

In this corrected version, the instruction is read from `IR` (Instruction Register) instead of a hypothetical `instruction` signal.

## USER
now instantiate the mux for the PC input and the PC register also as a shift register, using the wires you already defined

## ASSISTANT
Certainly, the Program Counter (PC) can be implemented with another shift register, and we can create a multiplexer to control the PC input. Here's how you can do it:

```verilog
// Define PC scan chain wires
wire scan_in_PC, scan_out_PC;

// PC register instantiation
shift_register #(
    .WIDTH(8)  // Set width to 8 bits
) PC_Register (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .enable(PC_write_enable),
    .data_in(PC_input),
    .data_out(PC),
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),            // Scan chain enable signal
    .scan_in(scan_in_PC),                 // Scan chain input
    .scan_out(scan_out_PC)                // Scan chain output
);

// Multiplexer for selecting PC input
wire [7:0] PC_input;
assign PC_input = (PC_mux_select == 2'b00) ? PC + 8'b00000001 :   // PC + 1 for FETCH cycle
                  (PC_mux_select == 2'b01) ? ACC :                // ACC for JMP and JSR
                  (PC_mux_select == 2'b10) ? PC + IMM :           // PC + IMM for forward branches
                  PC - IMM;                                       // PC - IMM for backward branches
```

In this code, the PC input is selected based on the `PC_mux_select` signal from the control unit. The `IMM` value used here is a placeholder for the actual immediate value used in the branch instructions, which you will need to replace with the correct immediate value based on your design. The PC Register is 8 bits wide to match the ISA specifications.

## USER
Instead of taking the IMM for the + and -, can you use the bottom three bits of the instruction register? 

## ASSISTANT
Sure, in the case where the immediate value is defined as the lower three bits of the instruction register, the multiplexer would be defined like this:

```verilog
// Define a 3-bit immediate value from the bottom three bits of the IR
wire [2:0] IMM3 = IR[2:0];  

// Multiplexer for selecting PC input
wire [7:0] PC_input;
assign PC_input = (PC_mux_select == 2'b00) ? PC + 8'b00000001 :   // PC + 1 for FETCH cycle
                  (PC_mux_select == 2'b01) ? ACC :                // ACC for JMP and JSR
                  (PC_mux_select == 2'b10) ? PC + {5'b0, IMM3} :  // PC + IMM for forward branches
                  PC - {5'b0, IMM3};                              // PC - IMM for backward branches
```

The `IMM3` signal is defined as the lower three bits of the instruction register `IR`. In the forward and backward branch cases of the multiplexer, `{5'b0, IMM3}` is used to form an 8-bit value by padding the 3-bit immediate value with five leading zeroes. This will ensure the PC will branch correctly relative to the immediate offset provided in the instruction.

## USER
Can you now instantiate the instruction register and any mux?

## ASSISTANT
Yes, the Instruction Register (IR) can also be implemented as a shift register. Here is how you can do it:

```verilog
// Define IR scan chain wires
wire scan_in_IR, scan_out_IR;

// IR register instantiation
shift_register #(
    .WIDTH(8)  // Set width to 8 bits
) IR_Register (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .enable(IR_load_enable),
    .data_in(Memory_data_out),
    .data_out(IR),
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),           // Scan chain enable signal
    .scan_in(scan_in_IR),                // Scan chain input
    .scan_out(scan_out_IR)               // Scan chain output
);
```

In this case, the IR register is loaded with data from memory (Memory_data_out) whenever IR_load_enable is high. 

Since the IR register only has one input (Memory_data_out) as per your ISA, there's no need for a multiplexer for its inputs. However, if the design required the IR to be loaded from multiple sources, a multiplexer would be needed. As of now, I'm assuming that the `Memory_data_out` wire is representative of the output from the memory module, and it will be defined and instantiated when you add the memory module.

## USER
we defined the memory data out wire as M_data_out earlier?

## ASSISTANT
I apologize for the confusion. You're correct. `Memory_data_out` should indeed be `M_data_out`, as defined earlier. Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
// IR register instantiation
shift_register #(
    .WIDTH(8)  // Set width to 8 bits
) IR_Register (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .enable(IR_load_enable),
    .data_in(M_data_out),
    .data_out(IR),
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),           // Scan chain enable signal
    .scan_in(scan_in_IR),                // Scan chain input
    .scan_out(scan_out_IR)               // Scan chain output
);
```

This assumes that the data output from the memory unit is being connected to the `M_data_out` wire. When the `IR_load_enable` signal is high, the IR register is loaded with the data from the `M_data_out` wire. The `scan_in_IR` and `scan_out_IR` wires are connected to the scan chain inputs and outputs for the IR register.

## USER
now can you instantiate the ACC register and any mux?

## ASSISTANT
Sure, the Accumulator (ACC) register can be implemented as a shift register, and it requires a multiplexer to select between different sources of input based on the `ACC_mux_select` signal. Here is how you can do it:

```verilog
// Define ACC scan chain wires
wire scan_in_ACC, scan_out_ACC;

// Multiplexer for selecting ACC input
wire [7:0] ACC_input;
assign ACC_input = (ACC_mux_select == 2'b00) ? ALU_result :
                   (ACC_mux_select == 2'b01) ? M_data_out :
                   (ACC_mux_select == 2'b10) ? PC_plus_1 :
                   CSR_data_out;

// ACC register instantiation
shift_register #(
    .WIDTH(8)  // Set width to 8 bits
) ACC_Register (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .enable(ACC_write_enable),
    .data_in(ACC_input),
    .data_out(ACC),
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),          // Scan chain enable signal
    .scan_in(scan_in_ACC),              // Scan chain input
    .scan_out(scan_out_ACC)             // Scan chain output
);
```

In this code, the multiplexer assigns the `ACC_input` wire to one of four possible sources: the `ALU_result`, the data from memory (`M_data_out`), the incremented program counter (`PC_plus_1`), or data from the CSR register (`CSR_data_out`), depending on the `ACC_mux_select` signal.

Then the accumulator register (ACC_Register) is instantiated. The data input is connected to the `ACC_input` wire, and it gets loaded when the `ACC_write_enable` signal is high.

Again, this assumes that the `ALU_result`, `PC_plus_1`, and `CSR_data_out` wires are representative of the outputs from the respective modules, and they will be defined and instantiated when you add these modules.

## USER
Actually given the multi-cycle nature of the processor, the ACC will never take in the "PC_plus_1" value, as PC will have already been incremented. It should just take in the PC value directly.

## ASSISTANT
You're correct. In a multi-cycle architecture, the PC is incremented in the fetch cycle, so by the time the ACC register could be loaded with PC value (in the execute cycle), PC has already been incremented. Here is the updated code that reflects this:

```verilog
// Define ACC scan chain wires
wire scan_in_ACC, scan_out_ACC;

// Multiplexer for selecting ACC input
wire [7:0] ACC_input;
assign ACC_input = (ACC_mux_select == 2'b00) ? ALU_result :
                   (ACC_mux_select == 2'b01) ? M_data_out :
                   (ACC_mux_select == 2'b10) ? PC :
                   CSR_data_out;

// ACC register instantiation
shift_register #(
    .WIDTH(8)  // Set width to 8 bits
) ACC_Register (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .enable(ACC_write_enable),
    .data_in(ACC_input),
    .data_out(ACC),
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),          // Scan chain enable signal
    .scan_in(scan_in_ACC),              // Scan chain input
    .scan_out(scan_out_ACC)             // Scan chain output
);
```

In the above code, `PC_plus_1` is replaced with `PC` in the multiplexer logic. Now, when `ACC_mux_select` is `2'b10`, `ACC_input` will be assigned the value from `PC`. This reflects the behavior you described.

## USER
Here is the ALU definition:
```verilog
module alu (
    input wire [7:0] A,
    input wire [7:0] B,
    input wire [3:0] opcode,
    output reg [7:0] Y
);
```
Can you instantiate this with the appropriate connections, as well as any mux it needs?

## ASSISTANT
Sure, I can instantiate the ALU. The ALU needs two inputs, A and B, as well as an opcode to specify the operation. The `A` input comes directly from the Accumulator, the `B` input can be either memory content or immediate value based on the ALU_inputB_mux_select wire, and the opcode comes from the control unit. The output `Y` of the ALU is the result of the operation.

Here is the code to instantiate the ALU, as well as the multiplexer needed to select the `B` input:

```verilog
// Define the ALU B input multiplexer
wire [7:0] ALU_inputB;
assign ALU_inputB = (ALU_inputB_mux_select == 1'b0) ? M_data_out : IMM;

// ALU instantiation
alu ALU (
    .A(ACC),
    .B(ALU_inputB),
    .opcode(ALU_opcode),
    .Y(ALU_result)
);
```

In the above code, `ALU_inputB` is assigned the value of `M_data_out` (memory content) when `ALU_inputB_mux_select` is `0`, and `IMM` (immediate value) when it is `1`. The ALU is then instantiated with these connections.

## USER
Can you write the line of code that computes IMM? We declared it but never assigned to it.

## ASSISTANT
In your ISA, immediate values come from the lower 4 bits of instructions, usually for `ADDI`, `LUI`, and `SETSEG` operations. We can define the `IMM` wire to directly reference these bits in the Instruction Register (IR). Since IR is 8 bits and we want the lower 4 bits, we can use bit-slicing to get this value.

Here is how we would define `IMM`:

```verilog
// Immediate value computation
wire [3:0] IMM;
assign IMM = IR[3:0];
```

In the above code, `IMM` is assigned the value of the lower 4 bits of the `IR`. This value will then be used by the ALU when performing immediate operations.

## USER
Can you instantiate the following module?
```module SegmentCheck(
  input [3:0] seg_addr,
  input [7:0] SEGEXE_H,
  input [7:0] SEGEXE_L,
  output reg illegal_segment_address
)```
It should take in the segment address from the PC (the upper bits), the SEGEXE wires which are already
 defined as SEGEXE_H_OUT and SEGEXE_L_OUT respectively, and emit the already-defined illegal_segment_execution wire.

## ASSISTANT
Absolutely, I'll instantiate the `SegmentCheck` module with the parameters you specified. The segment address is extracted from the upper 4 bits of the PC. Here's how you would do it:

```verilog
// Extracting the segment address from the upper 4 bits of PC
wire [3:0] seg_addr;
assign seg_addr = PC[7:4];

// Instantiating the SegmentCheck module
SegmentCheck Segment_Check (
    .seg_addr(seg_addr),
    .SEGEXE_H(SEGEXE_H_OUT),
    .SEGEXE_L(SEGEXE_L_OUT),
    .illegal_segment_address(illegal_segment_execution)
);
```

In the above code, `seg_addr` is assigned the value of the upper 4 bits of the `PC`. Then, the `SegmentCheck` module is instantiated with `seg_addr`, `SEGEXE_H_OUT`, `SEGEXE_L_OUT`, and `illegal_segment_execution` as inputs and output respectively.
