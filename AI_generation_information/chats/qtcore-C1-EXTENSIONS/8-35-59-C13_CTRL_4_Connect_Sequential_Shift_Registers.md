## USER
I have the following Verilog code which instantiates a 3-bit shift register connected to the scan_in and scan_out connections. Can you instantiate a further 1-bit shift register which is connected to wire the two shift registers together sequentially with a new connection for the scan out-to-in? Call it 'reserved' or something. The top-level scan_in can go to the new register, and the state register scan_in should come from the new register scan_out.
```verilog

## ASSISTANT
You would need to create an additional shift register module that has a width of 1 to accommodate the new 'reserved' register you mentioned. The top-level `scan_in` would go to this new shift register and then the `scan_out` from this new shift register would feed the `scan_in` of your existing shift register.

Here is an example of how you could implement it:

```verilog
// Instantiate shift register for new 'reserved' connection (one-bit)
reg reserved_in;
wire reserved_out;
shift_register #(
  .WIDTH(1)
) reserved_register (
  .clk(clk),
  .rst(rst),
  .enable(scan_enable),   // Assuming you want to enable this shift register with the scan_enable signal
  .data_in(reserved_in),
  .data_out(reserved_out),
  .scan_enable(scan_enable),
  .scan_in(scan_in),      // Taking top-level scan_in
  .scan_out()             // Not connecting this scan_out to top-level, as this will be used to feed state register
);

// Then, connect this output to your existing state_register's scan_in:

// Instantiate shift register for state storage (one-hot encoding)
shift_register #(
  .WIDTH(3)
) state_register (
  .clk(clk),
  .rst(rst),
  .enable(processor_enable),
  .data_in(state_in),
  .data_out(state_out),
  .scan_enable(scan_enable),
  .scan_in(reserved_out), // Connected to reserved register's scan_out
  .scan_out(scan_out)     // Output connected to top-level scan_out
);
```

Note that the new shift register `reserved_register` is enabled by `scan_enable`. This assumes you would want to enable the register when you are scanning. You can replace this with a different signal if you have one in mind. The `scan_in` of the new register is connected to the top-level `scan_in`, and its `scan_out` is left unconnected to the top-level because it will be used to feed into the state register's `scan_in`.

I would also like to point out that there are two similar pieces of code in your provided snippet. Please ensure to keep only one if they are meant to be the same. Also, if the shift_register module does not exist, you will need to define it, or ensure it's included from an external source.

## USER
Can you make a new wire for the scan_out of the reserved_register and connect it to the scan_in of the shift register? Also, set the enable and data_in of the reserved register to be permanently 0.

## ASSISTANT
Sure, you can create a new wire to connect the `scan_out` of the `reserved_register` to the `scan_in` of the `state_register`. Also, you can set the `enable` and `data_in` of the `reserved_register` to be permanently 0 by connecting them to a ground signal, like this:

```verilog
// Instantiate shift register for new 'reserved' connection (one-bit)
reg reserved_in = 1'b0;        // Permanently setting to 0
wire reserved_scan_out;        // New wire to connect scan_out of reserved_register to scan_in of state_register
shift_register #(
  .WIDTH(1)
) reserved_register (
  .clk(clk),
  .rst(rst),
  .enable(1'b0),             // Permanently setting enable to 0
  .data_in(reserved_in),
  .data_out(),               // Not used
  .scan_enable(scan_enable),
  .scan_in(scan_in),      // Taking top-level scan_in
  .scan_out(reserved_scan_out) // Connecting to new wire reserved_scan_out
);

// Then, connect this output to your existing state_register's scan_in:

// Instantiate shift register for state storage (one-hot encoding)
shift_register #(
  .WIDTH(3)
) state_register (
  .clk(clk),
  .rst(rst),
  .enable(processor_enable),
  .data_in(state_in),
  .data_out(state_out),
  .scan_enable(scan_enable),
  .scan_in(reserved_scan_out), // Now connected to new wire from reserved register's scan_out
  .scan_out(scan_out)     // Output connected to top-level scan_out
);
```
In the code above, the `reserved_in` and `enable` inputs of the `reserved_register` are set to `1'b0` which is a constant value of 0 in Verilog. This will ensure they are permanently set to 0. The new `reserved_scan_out` wire connects the `scan_out` of the `reserved_register` to the `scan_in` of the `state_register`.
