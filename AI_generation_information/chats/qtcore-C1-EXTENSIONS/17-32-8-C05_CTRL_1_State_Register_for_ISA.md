## List of registers and sizes

- **Program Counter (PC)**: 8 bits - Stores the address of the next instruction to be executed.
- **Accumulator (ACC)**: 8 bits - Stores the result of arithmetic and logical operations, as well as acts as a temporary storage for addresses during certain operations (e.g., JSR instruction).
- **Instruction Register (IR)**: 8 bits - Stores the current instruction being executed.
- **Segment Register (SEG)**: 4 bits - Handles the segment for memory operations.

);
// Control logic implementation goes here
endmodule

```

We have a one-hot state machine encoded as follows:

```verilog
// Instantiate the one-hot state register
wire [2:0] state_in, state_out;
one_hot_state_register state_register (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .enable(state_transition_enable), // enable signal to control state transitions
    .state_in(state_in),
    .state_out(state_out),
    .scan_enable(scan_enable),
    .scan_in(scan_in),
    .scan_out(scan_out)
);

// Define one-hot states
localparam [2:0] STATE_FETCH = 3'b001;
localparam [2:0] STATE_EXECUTE = 3'b010;
localparam [2:0] STATE_HALT = 3'b100;
```

Here is the logic for the state register:

```verilog
// Combinational logic for state_in and processor_halted
always @(*) begin
  // Default state: stay in the current state
  state_in = state_out;

  // Default processor_halted: set to 0
  processor_halted = 0;

  // Only advance state and update processor_halted if processor_enable is asserted
  if (processor_enable) begin
    case (state_out)
      STATE_RESET: begin
        // Move to STATE_FETCH when reset input is low
        if (!rst) begin
          state_in = STATE_FETCH;
        end
      end

      STATE_FETCH: begin
        // If the processor is halted, stay in the HALT state
        if (instruction == 8'b11111111) begin
          state_in = STATE_HALT;
        end
        // Otherwise, move to the EXECUTE state
        else begin
          state_in = STATE_EXECUTE;
        end
      end

      STATE_EXECUTE: begin
        // If the processor is halted, move to the HALT state
        if (instruction == 8'b11111111) begin
          state_in = STATE_HALT;
        end
        // Otherwise, move back to the FETCH state
        else begin
          state_in = STATE_FETCH;
        end
      end

      STATE_HALT: begin
        // Stay in HALT state unless reset occurs
        if (rst) begin
          state_in = STATE_FETCH;
        end
        // Otherwise, maintain the HALT state and set processor_halted
        else begin
          processor_halted = 1;
        end
      end

      default: begin
        // Default behavior (should never be reached in this implementation)
        state_in = STATE_FETCH;
        processor_halted = 0;
      end
    endcase
  end
end
```
## TASK
Does the state register logic correctly implement what is needed for the ISA? If not, what changes are needed?


## ASSISTANT
The state register logic does indeed correctly implement the expected functionality for this Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), except for one crucial aspect: illegal segment execution. According to the provided input wire, `illegal_segment_execution`, it seems the architecture intends to handle cases where a segment executed is considered illegal. However, the current state register logic does not take into account this input wire at all.

An illegal segment execution scenario might occur due to an attempted access to a restricted segment or due to a segment overflow, for example. In such a situation, we would want the processor to halt or to implement some error handling mechanism.

If we want to handle `illegal_segment_execution` by moving the state to `STATE_HALT` whenever it's high, the state register logic should be modified as follows:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
  // Default state: stay in the current state
  state_in = state_out;

  // Default processor_halted: set to 0
  processor_halted = 0;

  // Only advance state and update processor_halted if processor_enable is asserted
  if (processor_enable) begin
    case (state_out)
      STATE_RESET: begin
        // Move to STATE_FETCH when reset input is low
        if (!rst) begin
          state_in = STATE_FETCH;
        end
      end

      STATE_FETCH: begin
        // If the processor is halted or illegal segment execution, stay in the HALT state
        if (instruction == 8'b11111111 || illegal_segment_execution) begin
          state_in = STATE_HALT;
        end
        // Otherwise, move to the EXECUTE state
        else begin
          state_in = STATE_EXECUTE;
        end
      end

      STATE_EXECUTE: begin
        // If the processor is halted or illegal segment execution, move to the HALT state
        if (instruction == 8'b11111111 || illegal_segment_execution) begin
          state_in = STATE_HALT;
        end
        // Otherwise, move back to the FETCH state
        else begin
          state_in = STATE_FETCH;
        end
      end

      STATE_HALT: begin
        // Stay in HALT state unless reset occurs
        if (rst) begin
          state_in = STATE_FETCH;
        end
        // Otherwise, maintain the HALT state and set processor_halted
        else begin
          processor_halted = 1;
        end
      end

      default: begin
        // Default behavior (should never be reached in this implementation)
        state_in = STATE_FETCH;
        processor_halted = 0;
      end
    endcase
  end
end
```

This will ensure that the system properly handles illegal segment executions by moving to a halt state. It's important to note that this simple modification only addresses the halt condition, and does not provide a mechanism for addressing or recovering from an illegal segment execution. For a more comprehensive error handling mechanism, a more advanced design would be required.

## USER
Thanks. Here's the logic that drives the PC signals. Can you finish this off for me?
```verilog
always @(*) begin
    // Default values
    PC_write_enable = 1'b0;
    PC_mux_select = 2'b00;

    case (state_out)
        STATE_FETCH: begin
            PC_write_enable = 1'b1;
            PC_mux_select = 2'b00;
        end
        STATE_EXECUTE: begin

        end
        STATE_HALT: begin
            PC_write_enable = 1'b0;
            PC_mux_select = 2'b00;
        end
    endcase
end
```

This logic controls the behavior of the program counter (PC) based on the current state and the instruction being executed. 

In the `FETCH` state, the PC is incremented by one, in order to fetch the next instruction from memory.

In the `EXECUTE` state, the PC's behavior depends on the instruction. For the `JMP` and `JSR` instructions, the PC is loaded with the value in the accumulator (ACC). For the `BEQ`, `BNE`, and `BRA` instructions, the PC is updated based on the instruction's sign and offset.

In the `HALT` state, the PC is not changed. 

It's important to note that for the `BEQ`, `BNE`, and `BRA` instructions, the control signal `PC_write_enable` is controlled by the value of the Zero Flag (ZF), the result of the comparison in the case of `BEQ` and `BNE`, or is always enabled in the case of `BRA`. For `BEQ` and `BNE`, the PC is only updated if the comparison result (ACC equal to 0 or not) matches the instruction's requirement.

## USER
Can you rewrite it to not use X in the case statement? Perhaps by using a secondary case statement?

## ASSISTANT
Sure, here is the code updated to use secondary case statements to handle the first four bits of the instruction for `BEQ`, `BNE`, and `BRA`:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    // Default values
    PC_write_enable = 1'b0;
    PC_mux_select = 2'b00;

    case (state_out)
        STATE_FETCH: begin
            PC_write_enable = 1'b1;
            PC_mux_select = 2'b00;
        end
        STATE_EXECUTE: begin
            case (instruction[7:4])
                4'b1111: begin // JMP or JSR
                    case (instruction[3:0])
                        4'b0000: begin // JMP
                            PC_write_enable = 1'b1;
                            PC_mux_select = 2'b01;
                        end
                        4'b0001: begin // JSR
                            PC_write_enable = 1'b1;
                            PC_mux_select = 2'b01;
                        end
                    endcase
                end
                4'b1100: begin // BEQ
                    PC_write_enable = ZF;
                    PC_mux_select = instruction[3] ? 2'b11 : 2'b10;
                end
                4'b1101: begin // BNE
                    PC_write_enable = ~ZF;
                    PC_mux_select = instruction[3] ? 2'b11 : 2'b10;
                end
                4'b1110: begin // BRA
                    PC_write_enable = 1'b1;
                    PC_mux_select = instruction[3] ? 2'b11 : 2'b10;
                end
                default: begin
                    PC_write_enable = 1'b0;
                    PC_mux_select = 2'b00;
                end
            endcase
        end
        STATE_HALT: begin
            PC_write_enable = 1'b0;
            PC_mux_select = 2'b00;
        end
    endcase
end
```
In this code, the `JMP` and `JSR` instructions are differentiated based on the last 4 bits of the instruction. The other instructions (`BEQ`, `BNE`, `BRA`) are differentiated based on the first 4 bits, as was done in the original version. However, they now have their own dedicated blocks in the case statement, which allows for a more explicit matching of instruction types and easier code interpretation.

## USER
Looks great. Can you now write and explain a similar Verilog block for driving the ACC control signals? Here's the start of what you previously wrote:
```verilog
always @(*) begin
  // Default values
  ACC_write_enable = 1'b0;
  ACC_mux_select = 2'b00;

  // Check if the current state is EXECUTE
  if (state_out == STATE_EXECUTE) begin
    // Immediate Data Manipulation Instructions
```

## ASSISTANT
Certainly. For this control block, we'll consider a set of instructions that could operate on an Accumulator (ACC) in a simple processor. This might include instructions such as `LOAD`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR
