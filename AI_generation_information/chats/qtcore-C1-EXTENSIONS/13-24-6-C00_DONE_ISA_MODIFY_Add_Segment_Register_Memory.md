## USER
I have the following ISA for an 8-bit accumulator-based processor.

I want to increase the maximum amount of addressable memory to 256 bytes by adding a segment register and changing the memory offsets to use the segment register (we'll have 16 16-byte segments). Let's make the modifications together. Can you rewrite the variable-data operands table to address only 16 bytes of memory now, where the memory is going to be accessed as M[Segment+Offset]?

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Here is your modified Instructions with Variable-Data Operands table. It now addresses only 16 bytes of memory at a time using the segment register for offset.

**Instructions with Variable-Data Operands**

| Instruction | Description                                             | Opcode (3 bits) | Operand (4 bits) | Register Effects                  |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| LDA         | Load Accumulator with memory contents                   | 000            | Memory Offset   | ACC <- M[Segment + Offset]        |
| STA         | Store Accumulator to memory                             | 001            | Memory Offset   | M[Segment + Offset] <- ACC        |
| ADD         | Add memory contents to Accumulator                      | 010            | Memory Offset   | ACC <- ACC + M[Segment + Offset]  |
| SUB         | Subtract memory contents from Accumulator               | 011            | Memory Offset   | ACC <- ACC - M[Segment + Offset]  |
| AND         | AND memory contents with Accumulator                    | 100            | Memory Offset   | ACC <- ACC & M[Segment + Offset]  |
| OR          | OR memory contents with Accumulator                     | 101            | Memory Offset   | ACC <- ACC \| M[Segment + Offset] |
| XOR         | XOR memory contents with Accumulator                    | 110            | Memory Offset   | ACC <- ACC ^ M[Segment + Offset]  |

Please note that this is assuming that the Segment register is added to the architecture of your processor and is used to shift the memory offset, effectively accessing different 16-byte segments of the 256-byte total memory. You would need additional instructions to load and manipulate the Segment register.

## USER
Cool, can you now make it so the opcodes of each of these instructions start with a 0 and are 4 bits instead?

## ASSISTANT
Sure, I can update the table for you. Here is the revised version with the opcode expanded to 4 bits and each opcode starts with 0:

**Instructions with Variable-Data Operands**

| Instruction | Description                                             | Opcode (4 bits) | Operand (4 bits) | Register Effects                  |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| LDA         | Load Accumulator with memory contents                   | 0000           | Memory Offset   | ACC <- M[Segment + Offset]        |
| STA         | Store Accumulator to memory                             | 0001           | Memory Offset   | M[Segment + Offset] <- ACC        |
| ADD         | Add memory contents to Accumulator                      | 0010           | Memory Offset   | ACC <- ACC + M[Segment + Offset]  |
| SUB         | Subtract memory contents from Accumulator               | 0011           | Memory Offset   | ACC <- ACC - M[Segment + Offset]  |
| AND         | AND memory contents with Accumulator                    | 0100           | Memory Offset   | ACC <- ACC & M[Segment + Offset]  |
| OR          | OR memory contents with Accumulator                     | 0101           | Memory Offset   | ACC <- ACC \| M[Segment + Offset] |
| XOR         | XOR memory contents with Accumulator                    | 0110           | Memory Offset   | ACC <- ACC ^ M[Segment + Offset]  |

This table reflects the changes you requested, with opcode expanded to 4 bits and all instructions beginning with 0. Each instruction still performs its intended function, but now with the modified operand and opcode structure.

## USER
Can you now change the ADDI instruction to use the encoding 1000? Then we'll add more instructions to that space.

## ASSISTANT
Sure, here is the Immediate Data Manipulation Instructions table with the ADDI instruction updated to use the opcode 1000:

**Immediate Data Manipulation Instructions**

| Instruction | Description                          | Opcode (4 bits) | Immediate (4 bits) | Register Effects  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| ADDI        | Add immediate to Accumulator         | 1000           | 4-bit Immediate    | ACC <- ACC + IMM  |

This change leaves the opcode range 1001-1111 available for additional instructions in this category.

## USER
Can you now add instructions LUI which loads the 4-bit immediate to the upper 4 bits of the accumulator and sets the bottom 4 bits to 0?

## ASSISTANT
Of course! Here's the updated table with the newly added `LUI` instruction:

**Immediate Data Manipulation Instructions**

| Instruction | Description                                   | Opcode (4 bits) | Immediate (4 bits) | Register Effects          |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| ADDI        | Add immediate to Accumulator                  | 1000           | 4-bit Immediate    | ACC <- ACC + IMM          |
| LUI         | Load Upper Immediate to Accumulator           | 1001           | 4-bit Immediate    | ACC <- IMM << 4, ACC[0:3] <- 0 |

The `LUI` instruction takes a 4-bit immediate value, loads it into the upper 4 bits of the accumulator, and sets the lower 4 bits of the accumulator to zero. Please note the use of the opcode 1001 for this new instruction.

## USER
Now add an instruction to set the 4-bit segment register to the immediate

## ASSISTANT
Certainly! Here's your updated table with the new `SETSEG` instruction that sets the 4-bit segment register to the immediate value:

**Immediate Data Manipulation Instructions**

| Instruction | Description                                   | Opcode (4 bits) | Immediate (4 bits) | Register Effects             |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| ADDI        | Add immediate to Accumulator                  | 1000           | 4-bit Immediate    | ACC <- ACC + IMM             |
| LUI         | Load Upper Immediate to Accumulator           | 1001           | 4-bit Immediate    | ACC <- IMM << 4, ACC[0:3] <- 0 |
| SETSEG      | Set Segment Register to Immediate             | 1010           | 4-bit Immediate    | Segment <- IMM               |

In this table, the `SETSEG` instruction uses the opcode 1010. This instruction sets the segment register to the 4-bit immediate value provided with the instruction.

## USER
Can you reserve the 1011 space for further segment manipulation instructions?

## ASSISTANT
Absolutely, you can reserve the opcode 1011 for future segment manipulation instructions. Here's the updated table:

**Immediate Data Manipulation Instructions**

| Instruction | Description                                   | Opcode (4 bits) | Immediate (4 bits) | Register Effects             |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| ADDI        | Add immediate to Accumulator                  | 1000           | 4-bit Immediate    | ACC <- ACC + IMM             |
| LUI         | Load Upper Immediate to Accumulator           | 1001           | 4-bit Immediate    | ACC <- IMM << 4, ACC[0:3] <- 0 |
| SETSEG      | Set Segment Register to Immediate             | 1010           | 4-bit Immediate    | Segment <- IMM               |
| RESERVED    | Reserved for Segment Manipulation Instructions| 1011           | 4-bit Immediate    | TBD                          |

In this table, the opcode 1011 is marked as `RESERVED` and is intended for future use related to segment manipulation instructions. The effects on registers are currently marked as "TBD" (To Be Determined).

## USER
Here are the previous branch instructions. 
**Control and Branching Instructions**

| Instruction  | Description                                     | Opcode (8 bits) | PC Behavior                                                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JMP          | Jump to memory address                          | 11110000       | PC <- ACC (Load the PC with the address stored in the accumulator)            |
| JSR          | Jump to Subroutine (save address to ACC)        | 11110001       | ACC <- PC + 1, PC <- ACC (Save the next address in ACC, then jump to the address in ACC) |
| BEQ_FWD      | Branch if equal, forward (branch if ACC == 0)   | 11110010       | If ACC == 0, then PC <- PC + 2 (Jump 1 instruction forward if ACC is zero)    |
| BEQ_BWD      | Branch if equal, backward (branch if ACC == 0)  | 11110011       | If ACC == 0, then PC <- PC - 2 (Jump 1 instruction backward if ACC is zero)   |
| BNE_FWD      | Branch if not equal, forward (branch if ACC != 0)| 11110100       | If ACC != 0, then PC <- PC + 2 (Jump 1 instruction forward if ACC is non-zero)|
| BNE_BWD      | Branch if not equal, backward (branch if ACC != 0)| 11110101       | If ACC != 0, then PC <- PC - 2 (Jump 1 instruction backward if ACC is non-zero)|
| HLT          | Halt the processor until reset                  | 11111111       | Stop execution (PC does not change until a reset occurs)                      |

Can you split this into two tables, one for "fixed control and branching instructions JMP/JSR/HLT" (keep their current 8-bit opcodes) and one for "variable-operand branching instructions", then make BNE and BEQ instructions to take a 4 bit operand, 1 being a sign bit and 3 bits being a magnitude, to change the PC? They can be at opcodes 1100 and 1101 respectively.


## ASSISTANT
Absolutely, here are the updated tables split into "Fixed Control and Branching Instructions" and "Variable-Operand Branching Instructions" as per your request:

**Fixed Control and Branching Instructions**

| Instruction  | Description                                     | Opcode (8 bits) | PC Behavior                                                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JMP          | Jump to memory address                          | 11110000       | PC <- ACC (Load the PC with the address stored in the accumulator)            |
| JSR          | Jump to Subroutine (save address to ACC)        | 11110001       | ACC <- PC + 1, PC <- ACC (Save the next address in ACC, then jump to the address in ACC) |
| HLT          | Halt the processor until reset                  | 11111111       | Stop execution (PC does not change until a reset occurs)                      |

**Variable-Operand Branching Instructions**

| Instruction  | Description                                                 | Opcode (4 bits) | Operand (4 bits) | PC Behavior                                                                                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BEQ          | Branch if equal (branch if ACC == 0)                       | 1100           | Sign + Offset   | If ACC == 0, then PC <- PC + Offset if Sign is 0, or PC <- PC - Offset if Sign is 1                      |
| BNE          | Branch if not equal (branch if ACC != 0)                   | 1101           | Sign + Offset   | If ACC != 0, then PC <- PC + Offset if Sign is 0, or PC <- PC - Offset if Sign is 1                      |

In this new format, the `BEQ` and `BNE` instructions now take a 4-bit operand, where the first bit is used as a sign bit and the following 3 bits are used as an offset magnitude. These instructions will increment or decrement the PC by the offset value based on the accumulator's value and the sign bit. The opcode for `BEQ` is 1100, and for `BNE` is 1101.

## USER
Can you add another instruction to the Variable-Operand branching instructions table which will always perform the jump? Some kind of relative jump instruction?

## ASSISTANT
Absolutely, let's add a `BRA` (Branch Always) instruction to the "Variable-Operand Branching Instructions" table. This instruction would change the PC regardless of the accumulator's value. We can use the opcode 1110 for this new instruction:

**Variable-Operand Branching Instructions**

| Instruction  | Description                                                 | Opcode (4 bits) | Operand (4 bits) | PC Behavior                                                                                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BEQ          | Branch if equal (branch if ACC == 0)                       | 1100           | Sign + Offset   | If ACC == 0, then PC <- PC + Offset if Sign is 0, or PC <- PC - Offset if Sign is 1                      |
| BNE          | Branch if not equal (branch if ACC != 0)                   | 1101           | Sign + Offset   | If ACC != 0, then PC <- PC + Offset if Sign is 0, or PC <- PC - Offset if Sign is 1                      |
| BRA          | Branch always                                               | 1110           | Sign + Offset   | PC <- PC + Offset if Sign is 0, or PC <- PC - Offset if Sign is 1                                       |

With the `BRA` instruction, the PC will always increment or decrement by the offset, depending on the sign bit, regardless of the accumulator's value.

## USER

0010MMM - ADD
...
1000IIII - ADDI
....
11110000 - JMP
...

## USER
Can you add an instruction to set the segment register to the bottom 4 bits of the accumulator as 11000001?

## ASSISTANT
Sure! Let's call this instruction `SETSEG_ACC`. Here is the addition to the Immediate Data Manipulation Instructions:

**Immediate Data Manipulation Instructions**

| Instruction | Description                                         | Opcode (8 bits) | Register Effects |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| ADDI        | Add immediate to Accumulator                        | 1000IIII       | ACC <- ACC + IMM |
| LUI         | Load Upper Immediate to Accumulator                 | 1001IIII       | ACC <- IMM << 4  |
| SETSEG      | Set Segment Register to Immediate                   | 1010IIII       | SEG <- IMM       |
| SETSEG_ACC  | Set Segment Register to Lower 4 bits of Accumulator | 11000001       | SEG <- ACC[3:0]  |

With this instruction, the segment register can be updated from the accumulator, making memory management more flexible.

The opcode list now includes:

11000001 - SETSEG_ACC (Set Segment Register to Lower 4 bits of Accumulator)

## USER
Can you add two more instructions to set segments to executable or non-executable?

## ASSISTANT
Absolutely! I'll add two new instructions: `SETEXE` and `SETNEXE`. The `SETEXE` instruction will mark the current segment as executable, and the `SETNEXE` instruction will mark it as non-executable. Here are the updated tables:

**Immediate Data Manipulation Instructions**

| Instruction | Description                                         | Opcode (8 bits) | Register Effects |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| ADDI        | Add immediate to Accumulator                        | 1000IIII       | ACC <- ACC + IMM |
| LUI         | Load Upper Immediate to Accumulator                 | 1001IIII       | ACC <- IMM << 4  |
| SETSEG      | Set Segment Register to Immediate                   | 1010IIII       | SEG <- IMM       |
| SETSEG_ACC  | Set Segment Register to Lower 4 bits of Accumulator | 11000001       | SEG <- ACC[3:0]  |
| SETEXE      | Set Segment to Executable                           | 10110000       | SEG_EXEC <- True |
| SETNEXE     | Set Segment to Non-Executable                       | 10110001       | SEG_EXEC <- False|

Here SEG_EXEC denotes whether the segment is executable or not. A true value means it is executable and a false value means it is not.

So, the opcodes list now includes:

10110000 - SETEXE (Set Segment to Executable)

10110001 - SETNEXE (Set Segment to Non-Executable)

## USER
lets modify this idea, can we add two registers SEGEXE_H and SEGEXE_L and have instructions to load and store to these two registers from the accumulator? Put these and the existing SETSEG_ACC instruction in the 1011 prefix opcode space.

## ASSISTANT
Certainly, we can modify the instructions to work with two separate registers `SEGEXE_H` and `SEGEXE_L`. The instructions `SETEXE_H`, `SETEXE_L`, `LD_EXEH`, and `LD_EXEL` can be added to interact with these registers. Here's how that could look:

**Segment Data Manipulation Instructions**

| Instruction | Description                                                      | Opcode (8 bits) | Register Effects |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| SETSEG_ACC  | Set Segment Register to Lower 4 bits of Accumulator              | 10110001       | SEG <- ACC[3:0]  |
| SETEXE_H    | Load SEGEXE_H register from Accumulator                          | 10110010       | SEGEXE_H <- ACC  |
| SETEXE_L    | Load SEGEXE_L register from Accumulator                          | 10110011       | SEGEXE_L <- ACC  |
| LD_EXEH     | Load Accumulator from SEGEXE_H register                          | 10110100       | ACC <- SEGEXE_H  |
| LD_EXEL     | Load Accumulator from SEGEXE_L register                          | 10110101       | ACC <- SEGEXE_L  |

And here's how the opcodes list now looks:

10110001 - SETSEG_ACC (Set Segment Register to Lower 4 bits of Accumulator)

10110010 - SETEXE_H (Load SEGEXE_H register from Accumulator)

10110011 - SETEXE_L (Load SEGEXE_L register from Accumulator)

10110100 - LD_EXEH (Load Accumulator from SEGEXE_H register)

10110101 - LD_EXEL (Load Accumulator from SEGEXE_L register)

## USER
I've been thinking that we can actually make this more flexible by having 8 control and status registers and fit them into the 1011 space, then using a "1" or "0" as the next bit for R/W, then 3 bits for the control/status register number. Can you make this?
Have segment executable L and H, UART TX and RX, counter L and H, a status_control register, and a temporary register.

## ASSISTANT
Sure, that's a great idea! It will offer a lot more flexibility to the system. We can name these new instructions as `CSW` and `CSR` for Control/Status Register Write and Read respectively. The Control/Status Registers (CSR) can be enumerated as follows:

0 - `TEMP` (Temporary register)

1 - `SCREG` (Status_Control register)

2 - `CTR_H` (Counter High register)

3 - `CTR_L` (Counter Low register)

4 - `UART_RX` (UART Receive register)

5 - `UART_TX` (UART Transmit register)

6 - `SEGEXE_H` (Segment Executable High register)

7 - `SEGEXE_L` (Segment Executable Low register)

And here are the new instructions:

**Control/Status Register Manipulation Instructions**

| Instruction | Description                                    | Opcode (8 bits) | Register Effects     |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| CSR         | Read from Control/Status Register to Accumulator| 10110RRR       | ACC <- CSR[RRR]      |
| CSW         | Write from Accumulator to Control/Status Register| 10111RRR       | CSR[RRR] <- ACC      |

Here, `RRR` is the 3-bit index of the Control/Status Register.

So, the opcode list now includes:

10110RRR - CSR (Read from Control/Status Register to Accumulator)

10111RRR - CSW (Write from Accumulator to Control/Status Register)

The specific `RRR` values map to the control/status registers as described above.

## USER
That's great. I've done some copy pasting to make this spec:

Can you update the SHL4 instruction to be the SETSEG_ACC instruction? I don't think we will need it anymore with the new LUI instruction.

## ASSISTANT
Absolutely! I've updated the SETSEG_ACC instruction in the **Data Manipulation Instructions** table and replaced SHL4:

**Data Manipulation Instructions**

| Instruction | Description                                              | Opcode (8 bits) | Register Effects          |

| CLR         | Clear (Zero) Accumulator                                 | 11111101       | ACC <- 0                  |

Now, we've replaced the SHL4 operation with SETSEG_ACC which sets the Segment Register using the lower 4 bits of the Accumulator. This change should provide more utility in the context of the other updates to the instruction set.

## USER
Can you move the SETSEG_ACC command so it is next to LDAR? Update the opcodes to still be sequential.

## ASSISTANT
Sure, here's the updated **Data Manipulation Instructions** table with the SETSEG_ACC command moved next to the LDAR command:

The opcodes are now in sequential order and the SETSEG_ACC command is grouped with the LDAR command as requested.

## USER
Make it ACC[3:0] instead of 0:3, otherwise that might get confusing

## ASSISTANT
Sure, I've corrected that for you. 

Here is the updated **Data Manipulation Instructions** table:

Now, the SETSEG_ACC instruction takes the lower 4 bits of the accumulator (ACC[3:0]) to set the segment register.

Can you make it clear that the memory accesses are via concatenation, not addition? Use Verilog notation for the concatenation.

## ASSISTANT
Certainly, I can use the Verilog concatenation operator `{}`, which combines two or more bit strings end-to-end. The updated table would be:

In these instructions, `{Segment, Offset}` represents the concatenation of the segment register and the 4-bit memory offset to form an 8-bit address. This address is used to access the corresponding memory location.

## USER
Create a list of the CSRs - I would like there to be low and high registers for SEGEXE, change the UART to be IO_IN and IO_OUT, have a counter high and low, a status_control, and a temporary register

## ASSISTANT
Here is the list of the Control/Status Registers (CSRs):

| CSR Number (3 bits) | Register Name |
|---------------------|---------------|
| 000                 | SEGEXE_L      |
| 001                 | SEGEXE_H      |
| 010                 | IO_IN         |
| 011                 | IO_OUT        |
| 100                 | CNT_L         |
| 101                 | CNT_H         |
| 110                 | STATUS_CTRL   |
| 111                 | TEMP          |

- **SEGEXE_L** and **SEGEXE_H**: Lower and Higher 4 bits of the Segment Executable Address respectively.
- **IO_IN** and **IO_OUT**: Input/Output Registers for UART (or any general I/O device) operations.
- **CNT_L** and **CNT_H**: Lower and Higher 4 bits of a counter register.
- **STATUS_CTRL**: A control register to hold the status of different operations in the CPU.
- **TEMP**: A temporary register for general use.
